# Sunscope 🌻

Sunscope is an innovative tool designed to forecast sunflower yield per acre in the United States under different emissions scenarios. Utilizing cutting-edge explainable AI (XAI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, Sunscope identifies key climate variables influencing yield and aids in developing effective adaptation strategies. The project leverages data from USDA and NOAA databases, as well as the WorldClim repository, and employs R programming language and ArcGIS Pro software for comprehensive data processing and analysis.

## Features 🌟

- **Yield Forecasting:** Predict sunflower yield per acre under various emissions scenarios using advanced ML models.
- **Climate Variable Analysis:** Identify and analyze key climate variables that influence sunflower yield.
- **Adaptation Strategies:** Provide insights for developing adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change on sunflower yield.
- **Data Integration:** Utilize data from reputable sources like USDA, NOAA, and WorldClim for accurate and reliable analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for accessing and visualizing yield forecasts and climate variable insights.
